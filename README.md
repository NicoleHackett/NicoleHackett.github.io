# Data Journalism Portfolio
## Hello!
My name is Nicole Hackett. I'm a Junior at Lehigh University studying journalism and marketing. I also work as an editor and reporter for the _Brown and White Newspaper_. This portfolio will be used to collect and showcase my work from Data Journalism. 
Feel free to take a look at my [LinkedIn page](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nicole-hackett-51b599237/) for more about me and my experience!
