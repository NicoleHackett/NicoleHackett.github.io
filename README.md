# Data Journalism Portfolio
### Hello!
My name is Nicole Hackett. I'm a Junior at Lehigh University studying journalism and marketing. I also work as an editor and reporter for the _Brown and White Newspaper_. This portfolio will be used to collect and showcase my work from Data Journalism. 
Feel free to take a look at my [LinkedIn page](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nicole-hackett-51b599237/) for more about me and my experience!

### Infographic on Addiction
Below is an infographic containing important information and warning signs in regards to addiction. The graphic is broken up into 5 stages, which explains how an addiction tends to develope in an organized, clear manner. The 5 stages follow a timeline, starting with experimentation, regular use, risky use, dependence, upto addiction/recovery. In regards to how I decided to present the information, I wanted to make sure I explained how addiction is not a choice, but rather a disease. Yes, a factor of addiction is related to poor choices, but it's crucial that people are informed about the alterations in brain chemistry which ultimately lead to a full blown addiction. By explaining the scientific relationship between substances and the brain, this infographic can hopefully be a helpful resource in properly educating individuals and breaking stereotypes that are often placed on those who struggle with an addiction. This graphic can also lend as a helpful guide to those who are worried about a loved one who is struggling, explaining what concerns to keep note of and the potential reasons for them.

### A Timeline of Mac Miller
Below is a timeline of the life of famous musician, Mac Miller. It begins with his early childhood, moving into his career progression, and his passing in 2018. I chose to focus on him due to personal interest, but also his unique trajectory as an artist. During his time he worked with a variety of different musicans and producers, along with exploring several different generes. He had an intense passion for his art, and also shared his audinece to help other talented artists get their work out into the world. His lyrics and muscial composition connected with his fanbase as his music was authentic, honest, and true to himself.

### Bar/Column Chart
Below is a chart I created showcasing where undergradate students at Lehigh resided in 2021. As you can see, there are 4 living-space categories: residence halls, fraternities, soroities, and off-campus. The data is further broken up between gender for further insight. By creating a visulation of this data, I was able analyize and draw interesting conclusions I hadn't noticed priorly. For example, I expected the number of students living in Greek Life houses would be much higher, considering the cultures presence on Lehigh's campus. It's also interesting to see the residential choices and gender. The difference that caught my eye was how there are less women living off-campus compared to men. While this is partly due to there being more male undergraduates than female, I do wonder if there is another factor at play, which is safety. It's a possibility that more women choose to live on campus due to there being more resources to stay safe, for example, Lehigh has the blue-light system, automatic locking doors, and overall more secure buildings compared to a house off-campus. While I don't want to generalize based on this singular data set, it is an aspect of college culture and gender disparity that further interests me.

### A Line Graph of Lehigh's Undergraduate Enrollment
Below is a graph illustrating the shift in Lehigh's enrollment from 2016 to 2020 seperated by colleges including: Arts & Sciences, Business, and Engineering. You can see a trend, as the student population increases overall, enrollment in Engineering decreases as enrollment in Arts & Sciences increases. This is particularly interesting as Lehigh is known for it's high-quality engineering school. I further wonder why this decrease it happeneig. Is it COVID related? Did the Arts & Sciences program improve? Are students switching colleges? Is it related to who Lehigh is deciding to accept each year? I collected all my data from Lehigh's [Institutional Profile](https://data.lehigh.edu/university-profile).

### Life Satisfaction Vs. GDP Per Capita, 2017
Below is a scatter plot represented the average self-reported life satisfaction in different countries compared the GDP Per Capita in each country. Finland has the highest life satisfaction rate, coming in just below 8. I found it interesting that their GDP is neither low or high, it falls in the middle compared to the other countries in this data set. The country with the lowest life satisfaction rates is more closely correlated with their GDP. This would be Afghanistan. Their life satisfaction comes out to an average of about 2.5, and their GDP is at about 1803.

### Ten Warmest Years (1880–2022)
The line chart below represents the ten warmest years, combining land and ocean tempuratures averaged annually. The far left point represents the warmest year to date, which is 2016. Number ten, which is the lowest point on this chart represents 2010. Every point within the middle of the chart ranges from 2010 to 2022, the latest year recorded so far. The term anomaly in both °C and °F refers to the average temperature recorded for each year. Considering the National Center for Environment Information has average tempuratures recorded dated back to 1880, it's signifigant that the warmest years were all within about the past decade. This line graph further shows the magnitude of global warming in its current state. If the this trend continues, it can be expected that 2023 will lie somewhere in the top ten, moving the earliest date, 2010, off the list completely.

### 2019 World's Top 20 Cycling Cities 
Below is a visual representing the top 20 cities with the best cycling. There seems to be a trend in Europe having the highest ranked cities, with Copenhagen, Denmark at number one. The top ten cities are actually entirely located in Europe. There are no cities located in the United States, Russia, Austrailia, or Africa. It's interesting to see where cycling is most popular, and how those top cities are so close together.

### Harry Styles: Live on Tour 2017 Vs. 2018
Live on Tour was Harry Styles first world tour as a solo artist following his departure from the band One Direction. The tour started out in 2017 in San Francisico. Through late September to early October, Styles went to various U.S. locations to play in small, intimate setting. The highest attendted concert during his first round in the states was in Radio City Music Hall in New York City, with only about 5,900 attendees. Nine months later, after touring abroad, he returned to finish Live on Tour back in the United States. This time around he played in much larger stadiums. Attendance through June 2018 to July 2018 never went below 12,000, over double the size of the shows he was playing back in 2017. For more information, please visit this link from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Styles:_Live_on_Tour) which keeps a record of tour dates, locations, attendence, and revenue.

### Interactive Data Visualization
Below is an interactive data visualization I created by using Tableau Software. By using data collected by Lehigh students about party culture, I was able to create two charts that showcase interesting insights. The first is a chart representing students who have experienced unsafe conditions at off-campus parties. I further seperated the data by gender as I was interested to see if there was a difference between male and female students. To my surprise, based on the data these students collected, the students who have not experienced unsafe conditions outweighed those who have. Also, there were less female students who answered yes than male, which is also not what I was expecting. I do wonder if this has to do with female students taking more procaution in general when partying. For instance, most tend to stay in trusted groups and keep in contact throughout the night. The second chart I created showcases drinking habits depending on the location of the party (off-campus vs. on). I also decided to furhter analyze the data by gender. Most female students said they tend to drink more at on-campus parties, but most male students said they don't drink more/less at either. It's interesting to see that the least amount of students in both groups answered off-campus. I wonder, again, if this is due to safety procautions, or if it's due to a different trend.
