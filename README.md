### Infographic on Addiction
Below is an infographic containing important information and warning signs in regards to addiction. The graphic is broken up into 5 stages, which explains how an addiction tends to develope in an organized, clear manner. The 5 stages follow a timeline, starting with experimentation, regular use, risky use, dependence, upto addiction/recovery. In regards to how I decided to present the information, I wanted to make sure I explained how addiction is not a choice, but rather a disease. Yes, a factor of addiction is related to poor choices, but it's crucial that people are informed about the alterations in brain chemistry which ultimately lead to a full blown addiction. By explaining the scientific relationship between substances and the brain, this infographic can hopefully be a helpful resource in properly educating individuals and breaking stereotypes that are often placed on those who struggle with an addiction. This graphic can also lend as a helpful guide to those who are worried about a loved one who is struggling, explaining what concerns to keep note of and the potential reasons for them.

### A Timeline of Mac Miller
Below is a timeline of the life of famous musician, Mac Miller. It begins with his early childhood, moving into his career progression, and his passing in 2018. I chose to focus on him due to personal interest, but also his unique trajectory as an artist. During his time he worked with a variety of different musicans and producers, along with exploring several different generes. He had an intense passion for his art, and also shared his audinece to help other talented artists get their work out into the world. His lyrics and muscial composition connected with his fanbase as his music was authentic, honest, and true to himself.

### Bar/Column Chart
Below is a chart I created showcasing where undergradate students at Lehigh resided in 2021. As you can see, there are 4 living-space categories: residence halls, fraternities, soroities, and off-campus. The data is further broken up between gender for further insight. By creating a visulation of this data, I was able analyize and draw interesting conclusions I hadn't noticed priorly. For example, I expected the number of students living in Greek Life houses would be much higher, considering the cultures presence on Lehigh's campus. It's also interesting to see the residential choices and gender. The difference that caught my eye was how there are less women living off-campus compared to men. While this is partly due to there being more male undergraduates than female, I do wonder if there is another factor at play, which is safety. It's a possibility that more women choose to live on campus due to there being more resources to stay safe, for example, Lehigh has the blue-light system, automatic locking doors, and overall more secure buildings compared to a house off-campus. While I don't want to generalize based on this singular data set, it is an aspect of college culture and gender disparity that further interests me.
